# Credit-Card-Transaction-Fraud-Detection-Using-Explainable-AI

### Description
This project contains the credit card fraud detection system that leverages advanced machine learning algorithms, including neural networks and random forests, to identify fraudulent transactions. The project utilizes synthetic data from the Sparkov dataset and real-world data from Kaggleâ€™s credit card fraud detection dataset to train and evaluate the model.

Key features of the project include:
- **Model Development**: Custom-built fraud detection models using various machine learning techniques, ensuring adaptability and performance.
- **Explainable AI Integration**: Implement Explainable AI methods such as LIME and SHAP to provide clear insights into model predictions, enhancing user understanding and trust.
- **Testing and Evaluation**: Rigorous testing on both synthetic and real-world datasets, with performance metrics including precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC. User feedback will be collected to assess the interpretability of the model's outputs.
- **Resources**: The project utilizes popular machine learning libraries (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, PyTorch) and data generation tools (Faker) to facilitate the creation of synthetic datasets.

### Data Sources
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: To generate synthetic credit card transaction data, including fraudulent transactions, refer to the [Sparkov Data Generation repository](https://github.com/namebrandon/Sparkov_Data_Generation).
- **Combined Dataset**: The combined dataset from Sparkov Data Generation, converted into a standard format, can be accessed [here on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection).

This repository is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the intersection of fraud detection and explainable AI, providing a foundation for further exploration and development in this critical area of financial security.
